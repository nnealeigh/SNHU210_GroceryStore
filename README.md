#GroceryStore

##Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  A simple grocery store tool for tracking purchased items and their quantities. Reads a file line by line, creates a dictionary where key is the item and value is the     frequency it appears in the .txt. Creates/writes .dat with item and frequency. Displays a menu to output all items and their frequency, or the frequency of a specific   item. Outputs a histogram giving a visual reference to the item/frequency pairs. 
  
##What did you do particularly well?
  I think that I formatted my histogram pretty well. It took me a bit of time to get the alignments working so that all bars in the histogram would start at the same       point. 
  
##Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I didn't write this with security in mind, and I'm not sure how to make improvements on it. Therefore, there are likely things I overlooked and can be improved within    that area. 
  
##Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  I didn't find anything particularly challenging here. Getting colors to work well with the output statements was slightly difficult, I used stack overflow and           geeksforgeeks to reference portions. 
  
##What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  Integrating python with another language could come in use in the future. Getting more experience in python has been great for me. So far, I have become much better at   making a good menu loop with exit options, and I feel that that will be applicable to many tasks. 
  
##How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I stuck to standard naming conventions and tried to comment throughout my code where I felt it was needed. I made sure to use functions where I felt they were needed,   therefore large and repetitive parts of the code can be accomplished by calling those functions.
